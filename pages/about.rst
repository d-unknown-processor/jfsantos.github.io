My name is João Felipe Santos. I received my bachelor degree in
Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina
(Florianópolis/Santa Catarina/Brazil) in 2011 and joined the INRS
(Montréal/QC/Canada) as a master student in 2012. My main research
areas is speech/audio signal processing.

This blog is an attempt to document interesting things such as tools,
software libraries, methodologies, etc., that I discovered during my
research and (hopefully) can be useful for somebody else.
